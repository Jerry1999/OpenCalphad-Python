# Compiling OC-Python's Documentation

The docs for OC-Python are built with Sphinx. To compile the docs, Sphinx and the related extensions must be installed first.

```
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx_copybutton
```

Then static HTML pages are generated by Makefile.

```
make html
```

The generated docs will be in the build/html directory and can be viewed by opening index.html.
